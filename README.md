# Maya_Deanna-workflow
Maya and Deanna's Github Workflow Activity


# This is the repository for Maya and Deanna's Github Workflow Activity.


## Deanna

In the first part of the activity,

we learned that:

1. There are many licenses available for github repositories
2. the .gitignore is optional
3. you do not have to initialize a README.md


## Maya

### Initial Steps
I learned that GitHub has a variety of different preset licenses and standard gitignore files to choose from while initializing a repository.

### Creating issues
I created an issue in GitHub for the first time. I learned that GitHub has a featured for recognizing possible related issues while creating new issues, as it suggested that the issues I was creating were related to each other.


## Fixing Merge Conflicts, Pull Requests, and New Issues

Completing the Pull request instructions, Maya and I encountered a merge conflict.

We learned that in order to merge to the master branch, you must be on master. You can not merge to master from the other branch.

We also learned that there should be more than one remote url, especially if you have forked the repo. Your remote forked repo is origin, and
the original remote repo is upstream.
