# Maya_Deanna-workflow
Maya and Deanna's Github Workflow Activity

## Initial Steps
I learned that GitHub has a variety of different preset licenses and standard gitignore files to choose from while initializing a repository.

## Creating issues
I created an issue in GitHub for the first time. I learned that GitHub has a featured for recognizing possible related issues while creating new issues, as it suggested that the issues I was creating were related to each other.
