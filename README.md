# Maya_Deanna-workflow
Maya and Deanna's Github Workflow Activity


# This is the repository for Maya and Deanna's Github Workflow Activity.


## Deanna

In the first part of the activity,

we learned that:

1. There are many licenses available for github repositories
2. the .gitignore is optional
3. you do not have to initialize a README.md


## Maya

### Initial Steps
I learned that GitHub has a variety of different preset licenses and standard gitignore files to choose from while initializing a repository.

### Creating issues
I created an issue in GitHub for the first time. I learned that GitHub has a featured for recognizing possible related issues while creating new issues, as it suggested that the issues I was creating were related to each other.
