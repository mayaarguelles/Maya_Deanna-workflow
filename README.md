# Maya_Deanna-workflow
Maya and Deanna's Github Workflow Activity


# This is the repository for Maya and Deanna's Github Workflow Activity.

In the first part of the activity,

we learned that:

1. There are many licenses available for github repositories
2. the .gitignore is optional
3. you do not have to initialize a README.md
